Description: This package will create the hourly fractional variations
    for each grid cell with data in California.  The grid is defined
    by the ARB 4km grid.  The hourly fraction should be multiplied by
    the average annual daily traffic for the grid cell to get the
    hourly expected traffic volumes.
